abstract: |
  Wildfire is the most impactful natural disturbance to Canada's boreal and temperate forest biomes.  Current representations of fire impact on forest carbon stocks is limited to a single parameterization of fire severity (i.e. the fraction of biomass consumed) that assumes only high severity fires, despite a large and increasing evidence base of widespread mixed-severity wildfire.  In this submodel of the larger Generic Carbon Budget Model for forest carbon accounting, field measurements of biomass consumption as related to satellite-derived burn severity maps are interpretted from a fire physics and ecology perspective to derive algorithms to describe forest carbon fluxes in the immediate aftermath of fires.  Compared to the baseline high severity-only representation, this mixed severity modelling framework changes modelled total Carbon flux to the atmosphere by [###]%, with the largest changes in [pool].  Per fire energy release rates as detected by satellite yield a favourable rank correlation with this severity-only method, and regional estimates of atmospheric CO release by satellite compare favourably to outputs from this severity-driven model.

# Introduction

-   general introduction on forest carbon accounting in Canada (1 paragraph)

-   then talk about how fire in many years is the largest disturbance by area, and that current estimates broadly assume full severity when mapped by NBAC. But, we know that \<100% of burned area is high severity from Ellen's work and others.

-   to support recent advances in operational burn severity mapping for Canada, the CBM DMs also need to be upgraded.

-   In this document, we outline the evidence-based fire DMs proposed.

-   From a blend of aggregated field data linked to remotely sensed severity, as well as insights from fire physics and experimental fires.

-   Key knowledge gaps are also highlighted, with interim solutions presented until further quantification can be done in field studies (could be wildfire, experimental fires, or prescribed fires).

## Biomass pools of the Generic Carbon Budget Model

Short section explaining the pool definitions most relevant to fire.

## Axioms of forest carbon budget after fire

To simplify the process of the creation of the DMs as a distillation of the complexities of fire severity and combustion patterns, the following logical axioms are proposed and maintained throughout:

1.  DMs should be in terms of mortality, not survival

2.  Crown Fraction Burned (CFB) is a mass-based estimate of the portion of foliage consumed in flaming, and is inclusive of merchantable and submerchantable trees, both broadleaf and needleleaf

3.  Snags are inclusive of both those killed by prior fire as well as those killed by all other causes

4.  In submerchantable trees, mortality = CFB

5.  In submerchantable trees, mortality is \<= 1

6.  In merchantable stands, CFB \< mortality

7.  Survival = 1 - mortality

8.  CFB \< survival

9.  The girdled fraction of trees = mortality - CFB

10. Survival \<= 1 and also \>= 0

Of these, Crown Fraction Burned (CFB) is both highly critical and a concept used primarily in fire behaviour science but not carbon accounting nor fire ecology. CFB was introduced in the 1992 Fire Behaviour Prediction System documentation, and provides a simple continuous 0-100 variable for only the consumption of foliage (inclusive of both conifer and broadleaf), as opposed to ordinal and less precise systems like Crown Fire Severity Index that allows the user to specify moreso which pools of canopy biomass are consumed, but not the degree to which a given pool is consumed.

## Ground plot and remotely sensed fire severity data

Ellen to insert methods here - including the figure of where the samples are from etc.

## Combustion gas emission ratios

Certain variables, like the fractionation of CO2:CH4:CO, are constant throughout ecozones, but vary by flaming vs smouldering. They are defined in a global variables table:

```{r defineVars, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}


#populate the values first:


####OPTION 1 (preferred)
#values directly from CFFEPS-FireWork
#Note that we are using the flaming CO2/CH4/CO from CBM originally, and smouldering from CFFEPS, the emissions module for ECCC's FireWork national smoke model (http://www.geosci-model-dev.net/12/3283/2019/). Specifically, we are using the arithmetic average of "smouldering" and "residual" phases.
##global.vars <- list(0.89, 0.004, 0.07, 0.79, 0.013, 0.16) ##Note: this is the stoichiometrically correct ratio, which includes non-CH4 hydrocarbons AND total PM, so CO2+CO+CH4 is only ~0.96

####OPTION 2 (simple)
#The provided 0.9,0.01,0.09 represents an MCE of 0.90 and therefore a mixed plume very similar to that from ARCTAS data by Simpson et al 2011 (10.5194/acp-11-6445-2011)
global.vars <- list(0.9,0.01,0.09,0.9,0.01,0.09) ##using the same mixed plume from the current CBM, so flaming is the same as smouldering


#then label names
names(global.vars) <- array(c("FlamingCO2","FlamingCH4","FlamingCO","SmoulderingCO2","SmoulderingCH4","SmoulderingCO"))


#DID NOT RUN:
#global.vars$FlamingCO2 #returns desired value as double

#can add/subtract ecozones here as needed.  Note that Mixedwood Plains not included here (but could/should be)

##load Ellen's data (InterimValue==False)
VarDefs <- read.csv("~/nrcan-cfs-fire/FireDMs/FireDMTableDefs.csv")

VarDefs$SeverityClass <- factor(VarDefs$SeverityClass,levels = c("Low", "Mod", "High"))

#subset to just the variable of interest:
VarDefs.SW.Mort <- VarDefs[VarDefs$Variable.Name == "SW.Mort",]

```

```{r globalVarsEmissions, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE }
kbl(as.data.frame(global.vars), caption = "Emissions ratios in flaming and smouldering phase, updated to reflect values used in Canada's operational wildfire smoke emissions model, CFFEPS-Firework") %>%
  kable_minimal()  #%>%
          #kable_styling(latex_options = "scale_down") %>%
  #kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
```

where CO~2~ is responsible for `r as.numeric(global.vars$FlamingCO2)*100`% of emissions in the flaming phase, but only `r as.numeric(global.vars$SmoulderingCO2)*100`% of emissions in the smouldering phase, with a doubling of CO emissions and tripling of CH~4~ emissions. With a Global Warming Potential of CO equal to 1.9 and CH~4~ of 25, the Global Warming Potential per unit of biomass consumption in the smouldering phase is `r round(((as.numeric(global.vars$SmoulderingCO2*1+global.vars$SmoulderingCH4*25+global.vars$SmoulderingCO*1.9))/(as.numeric(global.vars$FlamingCO2*1+global.vars$FlamingCH4*25+global.vars$FlamingCO*1.9))),2)` times higher in global warming potential compared to flaming, not including differential aerosol production and injection heights, however. Note that these proposed emissions factors for flaming vs smouldering are aligned with those currently used in Canada's operational wildfire smoke air quality model, FireWork [@chen2019]. With flaming and smouldering each contributing roughly equally to wildfire emissions, these distinct flaming and smouldering emissions rates correspond well with aircraft smoke chemistry observations by [@simpson2011] and [@hayden2022] and are themselves very similar to prior emissions factors used in CBM. Note that as current described, the sum of CO~2~, CH~4~, and CO emissions from wildfires only represent approximately 95% of the fire carbon mass emitted to the atmosphere, with 0.5-2.0% of biomass emitted as particulate matter (e.g. PM2.5, but also PM1 and PM10 classes of particulates at 1 and 10 um diameters, respectively), and an additional 5% [@hayden2022] to as little as 1% [@simon2010] composed of non-methane organic gases that have a large range in global warming potentials as compared to CH~4~.

## Litter layer area-wise consumption by severity class

The litter layer forms the first biomass pool in which a spreading fire consumes fuel. In low-severity fires, the litter layer may be consumed little to no underlying duff material consumed, nor any tree mortality (!ref). Logically, since litter consumption is required for the ignition of the underlying duff layer, this litter area-wise fractional consumption also informs and constrains duff consumption.

```{r UnBurnedForestFloorByEcozone, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

##load Ellen's data (InterimValue==False)


#subset to just the variable of interest:
VarDefs.Unburned.Litter <- VarDefs[VarDefs$Variable.Name == "Unburned.litter.area",]



VarDefs.dt <- as.data.table(VarDefs.Unburned.Litter)

Unburned.Litter.wide <- dcast(VarDefs.dt,Ecozone~SeverityClass,value.var = "Value")

kbl(Unburned.Litter.wide, caption = "Unburned litter area by ecozone and severity class.  The majority of the data comes from studies in the Boreal Plains and Boreal Shield West, and so values are extrapolated from those two well-observed ecozones to all others.") %>%
  kable_minimal()#  %>%
          #kable_styling(latex_options = "scale_down") %>%
  #kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
```

## Duff Consumption

While consumption of fine fuels in the litter layer of the forest floor is nearly complete for any given fire intensity, consumption of deeper organic soil horizons (F+H layers in upland forests and upper peat layers in wetlands) is more drought dependent. In this scheme, we utilize the Forest Floor Fuel Consumption (FFFC) model of [@degroot2009], modified to only account for fuel horizons below the litter layer:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
FFFC = 0.016872 DC^{0.71}(FFFL-LL)^{0.671}-LL
\end{equation}
```
where DC is the Fire Weather Index Drought Code and FFFL is the Forest Floor Fuel Load (with ecozone averages given in [@letang2012] or site-level data). LL is the Litter Load, and is typically on the order of \unit{0.2\,kg\,m^{-2}} for most boreal forest upland and peatland sites [@thompson2017]. This distinction is necessary due to the flaming phase consumption of the litter layer as opposed to the smouldering phase consumption of deeper horizons (see previous section). While ultimately this scheme can be used on individual fires with estimated or measured fuel loading and specific Drought Code values, for the purposes of this first assessment, an ecozone-averaged fuel load and decadal composites of Drought Code is used to provide representative values. Specifically, a median Drought Code of detected fire hotspots in Canada from 2003-2021 using the same data as the Canadian CFEEPS-FireWork wildfire air quality model of [@chen2019] is presented below, along with proportional consumption values of the forest floor by ecozone:

```{r computeDuffConsump, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}


#load an array of median DC values by ecozone (provided here hardcoded from Quinn Barber's dataframes of all Canadian hotspots from CWFIS 2002-2022), using the exact same order of ecozones above:
Median.DC <- c(270,369,297,239,242,242,254,250,268,452,204,98,123)
Litter.Load <- 0.25 #litter load as an average from Thompson et al 2017, across a range of boreal forest sites, doi: 10.1139/cjfr-2016-0475

# then the median forest floor load, minus an average litter value (provided here hardcoded from 10.1139/x2012-093):
Duff.Load <- c(10.9,15,1.7,8.8,9.8,9.8,8.31,8.31,15.2,6,7.9,1.7,10.9)

Duff.Load <- Duff.Load - Litter.Load

Duff.consump.kg.m2 <- 0.016872*Median.DC^0.71*Duff.Load^0.671 - Litter.Load
Duff.consump.frac <- Duff.consump.kg.m2/(Duff.Load - Litter.Load)


# start creating a single list object to encapsulate all the modelling:
#where FFFC is "Forest Floor Fuel Consumption" a la de Groot's naming convention:

FFFC <- as.data.frame(cbind(ecozones.list,Median.DC,Duff.Load,round(Duff.consump.kg.m2,digits = 2),round(Duff.consump.frac,digits = 2)))
names(FFFC) <- c("Ecozone","Median.DC.of.burning","Median.Duff.Load.kg.m2","Duff.consump.kg.m2","Duff.consump.frac")
## for example:
#FFFC$Ecozone.name[1]

### and to query values:
#FFFC$Duff.consump.frac[FFFC$Ecozone == "BP"]
```

```{r DuffConsumpTable, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE }
kbl(FFFC, caption = "Fire Weather, fuel loading, and duff consumption values per ecozone") %>%
  kable_minimal()  #%>%
          #kable_styling(latex_options = "scale_down") %>%
  #kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
```

Little data is available on the fraction of woody debris consumption alongside fire severity measurements. Coarse woody debris of overstory stems that makes up the majority of woody debris biomass in Canada's boreal and temperate forests (!ref), with its moisture and consumption patterns largely follows the moisture regime of the Drought Code [@mcalpine1995]. As a result, in this modelling framework, the proportion of woody debris consumption (!!give diameter range of Med DOM) is assumed proportional to that of the duff consumption given in the equation above.

## Drivers of C losses in the tree canopy

### Overstory tree mortality and consumption

Though numerous process-driven tree mortality models are present and show significant skill in predicting tree mortality based on fire behaviour (i.e. flame length, rate of spread) (!ref FOFEM, Johnson etc), since the driving data in this model is satellite-derived fire severity over the landscape scale, fire behaviour metrics such as flame length are not available as a continuous mapped product.  Instead, softwood and hardwood overstory mortality is calculated per ecozone as a function of satellite-observed fire severity:

```{r MortByEcozone, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

VarDefs.dt <- as.data.table(VarDefs.SW.Mort)

SW.Mort.wide <- dcast(VarDefs.dt,Ecozone~SeverityClass,value.var = "Value")

kbl(SW.Mort.wide, caption = "Softwood fractional mortality by ecozone, as dervied from median values from field studies") %>%
  kable_minimal()#  %>%
          #kable_styling(latex_options = "scale_down") %>%
  #kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
```

A major distinction is made between softwood and hardwood trees, where in Canada's boreal forests, a large fraction of hardwood trees (specifically of the genii Populous and Betula) are able to resprout even when the main stem has been killed by an intense forest fire (!ref).  Accordingly, the root mortality rates differ greatly between softwoods and hardwoods.  Concurrently, the fraction of fine roots contained within the combustible forest floor layers can be a majority of the fine root biomass, and burns alongside the organic soils.  As a result, the calculation for softwood fine root consumption and mortality are as follows:


```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
FFFC = 0.016872 DC^{0.71}(FFFL-LL)^{0.671}-LL
\end{equation}
```


```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
FFFC = 0.016872 DC^{0.71}(FFFL-LL)^{0.671}-LL
\end{equation}
```

### Understory tree mortality and consumption

Foliage, then roots

### Snag consumption

### Other biomass pools: stumps and bark

DC.year$Duff.consump.kg.m2 <- 0.016872*DC.year$DC50^0.71*DC.year$Median.Forest.Floor.Load.kg.m2^0.671 - Litter.Load

##not sure the source of DC50 == 0 in CFSDB....
DC.year$DC50 <- ifelse(DC.year$DC50<20,20,DC.year$DC50)

# Appendix C: DM template (can delete in final draft)

First, a generic template for a fire DM is loaded, that can represent any ecozone. It comes in two parts: (1) a list of variables, some biophysical and not relating to fire severity (such as the portion of live branchwood that falls into the smaller size fraction); or (2) severity-specific variables (such as Crown Fraction Burn) for a severity class. The template is loaded, and replicated across the list of ecozones (or any spatial unit) desired. Other processes, such as the analysis of field data, can then be used to fill in ecozone-specific variables in severity classes.

An example of the variable definition template is as follows:

```{r varDefsExample, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kbl(head(VarDefs), caption = "Example of stored fire disturbance matrix precursor variable information") %>%
  kable_minimal()  %>%
          kable_styling(latex_options = "scale_down") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")



```

A plain language name for each variable is provided right in the data, as well.

A second template defines each flux in a Disturbance Matrix, with Source and Sink defined as precise character variables, and a plain language summary ("Process Synonym") included to tie this flux back to language used in the fire science literature. Pseudocode and notes are included in each flux, which is repeated for each fire severity class and ecozone. There are 3900 total fluxes, though many do not have sufficient information to describe differences between ecozones. Many of these are computed automatically, tying back into variables such as Crown Fraction Burned.

```{r SinkSourceExample, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kbl(head(SourceSink), caption = "Sample of disturbance matrix data file") %>%
  kable_minimal() %>%
          kable_styling(latex_options = "scale_down") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position") 



```

With both generic ecozone variables as well as severity-specific variables defined and the pseudocode for each flux included, actual DM values are computed as references to tables, subset by ecozone and severity class.

Note that rather than defining softwood crown fraction burned as a variable called "SW.CFB.Boreal.Plains" for each ecozone, there is a row in the VarDefs table that represents SW.CFB in each ecozone and for each severity class, thus avoiding the creation of large lists of manually entered variable names and values in the R environment. Instead, these values can be programmatically entered via external analysis of plot data (not covered here).
