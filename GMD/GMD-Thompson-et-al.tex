\#Introduction

\begin{itemize}
\item
  general introduction on forest carbon accounting in Canada (1
  paragraph)
\item
  then talk about how fire in many years is the largest disturbance by
  area, and that current estimates broadly assume full severity when
  mapped by NBAC. But, we know that \textless100\% of burned area is
  high severity from Ellen's work and others.
\item
  to support recent advances in operational burn severity mapping for
  Canada, the CBM DMs also need to be upgraded.
\item
  In this document, we outline the evidence-based fire DMs proposed.
\item
  From a blend of aggregated field data linked to remotely sensed
  severity, as well as insights from fire physics and experimental
  fires.
\item
  Key knowledge gaps are also highlighted, with interim solutions
  presented until further quantification can be done in field studies
  (could be wildfire, experimental fires, or prescribed fires).
\end{itemize}

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Biomass pools of the Generic Carbon Budget Model}

Short section explaining the pool definitions most relevant to fire.

\subsection{Axioms of forest carbon budget after fire}

To simplify the process of the creation of the DMs as a distillation of
the complexities of fire severity and combustion patterns, the following
logical axioms are proposed and maintained throughout:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  DMs should be in terms of mortality, not survival
\item
  Crown Fraction Burned (CFB) is a mass-based estimate of the portion of
  foliage consumed in flaming, and is inclusive of merchantable and
  submerchantable trees, both broadleaf and needleleaf
\item
  Snags are inclusive of both those killed by prior fire as well as
  those killed by all other causes
\item
  In submerchantable trees, mortality = CFB
\item
  In submerchantable trees, mortality is \textless= 1
\item
  In merchantable stands, CFB \textless{} mortality
\item
  Survival = 1 - mortality
\item
  CFB \textless{} survival
\item
  The girdled fraction of trees = mortality - CFB
\item
  Survival \textless= 1 and also \textgreater= 0
\end{enumerate}

Of these, Crown Fraction Burned (CFB) is both highly critical and a
concept used primarily in fire behaviour science but not carbon
accounting nor fire ecology. CFB was introduced in the 1992 Fire
Behaviour Prediction System documentation, and provides a simple
continuous 0-100 variable for only the consumption of foliage (inclusive
of both conifer and broadleaf), as opposed to ordinal and less precise
systems like Crown Fire Severity Index that allows the user to specify
moreso which pools of canopy biomass are consumed, but not the degree to
which a given pool is consumed.

\subsection{Canopy mortality from plot and remotely sensed data}

Ellen to insert methods here

\ldots{} the resulting field-based estimates of crown mortality by
ecozone are as follows:

\begin{table}

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The other key ecozone and severity-dependent variable provided by field
data is the area-wise fraction of completely unburned forest floor,
which varies widely by severity class:

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:UnBurnedForestFloorByEcozone}Unburned litter area by ecozone and severity class.  The majority of the data comes from studies in the Boreal Plains and Boreal Shield West, and so values are extrapolated from those two well-observed ecozones to all others.}

\end{table}

\subsection{Duff Consumption}

While consumption of fine fuels in the litter layer of the forest floor
is nearly complete for any given fire intensity, consumption of deeper
organic soil horizons (F+H layers in upland forests and upper peat
layers in wetlands) is more drought dependent. In this scheme, we
utilize the Forest Floor Fuel Consumption (FFFC) model of
\citep{degroot2009}, modified to only account for fuel horizons below
the litter layer:

\begin{equation}
FFFC = 0.016872 DC^{0.71}(FFFL-LL)^{0.671}-LL
\end{equation}

where DC is the Fire Weather Index Drought Code and FFFL is the Forest
Floor Fuel Load (with ecozone averages given in \citep{letang2012} or
site-level data). LL is the Litter Load, and is typically on the order
of \unit{0.2\,kg\,m^{-2}} for most boreal forest upland and peatland
sites (\citep{thompson2017}). This distinction is necessary due to the
flaming phase consumption of the litter layer as opposed to the
smouldering phase consumption of deeper horizons. While ultimately this
scheme can be used on individual fires with estimated or measured fuel
loading and specific Drought Code values, here we use ecozone-averaged
fuel loads and decadal composites of Drought Code to provide
representative values. Specifically, a median Drought Code of detected
fire hotspots in Canada from 2003-2021 using the same data as the
Canadian CFEEPS-FireWork wildfire air quality model of \citep{chen2019}
is presented below, along with proportional consumption values of the
forest floor by ecozone:

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Key calculations in fire C emissions}

Go over 4-5 key equations: CFB From mortality, etc. Spell out the
equations.

\subsection{Combustion gas emission ratios}

Certain variables, like the fractionation of CO2:CH4:CO, are constant
throughout ecozones, but vary by flaming vs smouldering. They are
defined in a global variables table:

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:globalVarsEmissions}Emissions ratios in flaming and smouldering phase, updated to reflect values used in Canada's operational wildfire smoke emissions model, CFFEPS-Firework}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{r|r|r|r|r|r}
\hline
FlamingCO2 & FlamingCH4 & FlamingCO & SmoulderingCO2 & SmoulderingCH4 & SmoulderingCO\\
\hline
0.9 & 0.01 & 0.09 & 0.9 & 0.01 & 0.09\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

where CO\textsubscript{2} is responsible for 90\% of emissions in the
flaming phase, but only 90\% of emissions in the smouldering phase, with
a doubling of CO emissions and tripling of CH\textsubscript{4}
emissions. With a Global Warming Potential of CO equal to 1.9 and
CH\textsubscript{4} of 25, the Global Warming Potential per unit of
biomass consumption in the smouldering phase is 1 times higher in global
warming potential compared to flaming, not including differential
aerosol production and injection heights, however. Note that these
proposed emissions factors for flaming vs smouldering are aligned with
those currently used in Canada's operational wildfire smoke air quality
model, FireWork \citep{chen2019}. With flaming and smouldering each
contributing roughly equally to wildfire emissions, these distinct
flaming and smouldering emissions rates correspond well with aircraft
smoke chemistry observations by \citep{simpson2011} and
\citep{hayden2022} and are themselves very similar to prior emissions
factors used in CBM. Note that as current described, the sum of
CO\textsubscript{2}, CH\textsubscript{4}, and CO emissions from
wildfires only represent approximately 95\% of the fire carbon mass
emitted to the atmosphere, with 0.5-2.0\% of biomass emitted as
particulate matter (e.g.~PM2.5, but also PM1 and PM10 classes of
particulates at 1 and 10 um diameters, respectively), and an additional
5\% \citep{hayden2022} to as little as 1\% \citep{simon2010} composed of
non-methane organic gases that have a large range in global warming
potentials as compared to CH\textsubscript{4}.

\subsection{Construction fire disturbance matrices}

First, a generic template for a fire DM is loaded, that can represent
any ecozone. It comes in two parts: (1) a list of variables, some
biophysical and not relating to fire severity (such as the portion of
live branchwood that falls into the smaller size fraction); or (2)
severity-specific variables (such as Crown Fraction Burn) for a severity
class. The template is loaded, and replicated across the list of
ecozones (or any spatial unit) desired. Other processes, such as the
analysis of field data, can then be used to fill in ecozone-specific
variables in severity classes.

An example of the variable definition template is as follows:

\begin{table}[!h]

\caption{\label{tab:varDefsExample}Example of stored fire disturbance matrix precursor variable information}
\centering
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{
\begin{tabular}[t]{l|l|l|l|r|l|l|l}
\hline
Ecozone & Pool & Plain.Language.Name & Variable.Name & Value & SeverityClass & InterimValue & Notes\\
\hline
AM & Branch & Softwood small branch fraction of total branchwood & SW.SmBranch.frac.of.tot.BW & 0.5 & NA & TRUE & \\
\hline
AM & Branch & Hardwood small branch fraction of total branchwood & HW.SmBranch.frac.of.tot.BW & 0.5 & NA & TRUE & \\
\hline
AM & Other & Softwood branchwood as portion of total "other" pool & SW.BW.frac.of.other & 0.4 & NA & TRUE & \\
\hline
AM & Other & Hardwood branchwood as portion of total "other" pool & HW.BW.frac.of.other & 0.4 & NA & TRUE & \\
\hline
AM & Other & Hardwood Bark as portion of "other" pool & HW.bark.frac.of.other & 0.1 & NA & TRUE & \\
\hline
AM & Other & Softwood Bark as portion of "other" pool & SW.bark.frac.of.other & 0.1 & NA & TRUE & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}}
\end{table}

A plain language name for each variable is provided right in the data,
as well.

A second template defines each flux in a Disturbance Matrix, with Source
and Sink defined as precise character variables, and a plain language
summary (``Process Synonym'') included to tie this flux back to language
used in the fire science literature. Pseudocode and notes are included
in each flux, which is repeated for each fire severity class and
ecozone. There are 3900 total fluxes, though many do not have sufficient
information to describe differences between ecozones. Many of these are
computed automatically, tying back into variables such as Crown Fraction
Burned.

\begin{table}[!h]

\caption{\label{tab:SinkSourceExample}Sample of disturbance matrix data file}
\centering
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{
\begin{tabular}[t]{l|r|l|l|l|l|l|l|r|l}
\hline
Ecozone & FluxID & Source & Sink & ProcessSynonym & Pseudocode & Notes & SeverityClass & Value & InterimValue\\
\hline
AM & 1 & Softwood Merchantable & Softwood Merchantable & Survival rate of large conifers & 1-mortality rate & Ellen provides & Low & 0.8 & TRUE\\
\hline
TP & 1 & Softwood Merchantable & Softwood Merchantable & Survival rate of large conifers & 1-mortality rate & Ellen provides & Low & 0.8 & TRUE\\
\hline
TSW & 1 & Softwood Merchantable & Softwood Merchantable & Survival rate of large conifers & 1-mortality rate & Ellen provides & Low & 0.8 & TRUE\\
\hline
BSW & 1 & Softwood Merchantable & Softwood Merchantable & Survival rate of large conifers & 1-mortality rate & Ellen provides & Low & 0.8 & TRUE\\
\hline
BP & 1 & Softwood Merchantable & Softwood Merchantable & Survival rate of large conifers & 1-mortality rate & Ellen provides & Low & 0.8 & TRUE\\
\hline
P & 1 & Softwood Merchantable & Softwood Merchantable & Survival rate of large conifers & 1-mortality rate & Ellen provides & Low & 0.8 & TRUE\\
\hline
\end{tabular}}
\end{table}

With both generic ecozone variables as well as severity-specific
variables defined and the pseudocode for each flux included, actual DM
values are computed as references to tables, subset by ecozone and
severity class.

Note that rather than defining softwood crown fraction burned as a
variable called ``SW.CFB.Boreal.Plains'' for each ecozone, there is a
row in the VarDefs table that represents SW.CFB in each ecozone and for
each severity class, thus avoiding the creation of large lists of
manually entered variable names and values in the R environment.
Instead, these values can be programmatically entered via external
analysis of plot data (not covered here).

\section{Figures and tables in appendices}

Regarding figures and tables in appendices, the following two options
are possible depending on your general handling of figures and tables in
the manuscript environment:

\subsection{Option 1}

If you sorted all figures and tables into the sections of the text,
please also sort the appendix figures and appendix tables into the
respective appendix sections. They will be correctly named
automatically.

\subsection{Option 2}

If you put all figures after the reference list, please insert appendix
tables and figures after the normal tables and figures.

To rename them correctly to A1, A2, etc., please add the following
commands in front of them: \texttt{\textbackslash{}appendixfigures}
needs to be added in front of appendix figures
\texttt{\textbackslash{}appendixtables} needs to be added in front of
appendix tables

Please add \texttt{\textbackslash{}clearpage} between each table and/or
figure. Further guidelines on figures and tables can be found below.
