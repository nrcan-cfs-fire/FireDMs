\begin{abstract}
Wildfire is the most impactful natural disturbance to Canada's boreal
and temperate forest biomes. Current representations of fire impact on
forest carbon stocks is limited to a single parameterization of fire
severity (i.e.~the fraction of biomass consumed) that assumes only high
severity fires, despite a large and increasing evidence base of
widespread mixed-severity wildfire. In this submodel of the larger
Generic Carbon Budget Model for forest carbon accounting, field
measurements of biomass consumption as related to satellite-derived burn
severity maps are interpretted from a fire physics and ecology
perspective to derive algorithms to describe forest carbon fluxes in the
immediate aftermath of fires. Compared to the baseline high
severity-only representation, this mixed severity modelling framework
changes modelled total Carbon flux to the atmosphere by {[}\#\#\#{]}\%,
with the largest changes in {[}pool{]}. Per fire energy release rates as
detected by satellite yield a favourable rank correlation with this
severity-only method, and regional estimates of atmospheric CO release
by satellite compare favourably to outputs from this severity-driven
model.

\section{Introduction}

general introduction on forest carbon accounting in Canada (1-2
paragraphs) and the concept of fire severity overall, and how these two
relate. Managed vs unmanaged forest natural disturbance accounting in
Canada, explain that part.

Wildfire is on par with insects as the largest stand-replacing
disturbance process in Canada's forest, impacting \textasciitilde1-3 Mha
of Canada's 355 Mha forested area in a typical year \citep{hanes2019}.
In Canada's reliable 40-year burned area record, six years have exceeded
4 Mha of burned area, largely in continental boreal and dry temperate
forests west of the Great Lakes. Of this, managed forest accounts for
xxx\% of the area burned between 1980 and 2022; publicly-owned forest
under long-term licence to private timber companies forms the vast
majority of Canada's managed forest \citep{stinson2019}, allowing for
simplified and harmonized forest inventory and carbon modelling across
jurisdictions (ref??). Burned area is dominated by a relatively small
number of very large fires, with 3\% of fires constituting 97\% of the
burned area \citep{stocks2002}. Lightning-caused fires account for
approximately half of all ignitions and between xxx and xxxx\% of burned
area, but no distinction is made between human and lightning ignition
for carbon accounting purposes. Annual burned area mapping at 30 metre
resolution is conducted using a composite of satellite and aerial
mapping; the relatively small number of large fires, and their slow
vegetation regeneration \citep{white2017} allows for reliable mapping
using multispectral imagery such as Landsat within the year of the fire
\citep{whitman2018}.

In CBM-CFS, spatially referenced stand lists representing large
homogenous stands that fall within spatial units (ecozone-provincial
intersections) are randomly (??) drawn, even when applying precisely
mapped burned areas. In Canada's forests, a combination of disturbance
history (), soils, and less frequently topographic variables determine
leading tree species; at local scales (1-100 ha), tree species plays a
major role in determining ecosystem susceptibility to fire
\citep{bernier2016} where older, conifer-dominated forests burn at very
high rates relative to adjacent deciduous or mixed stands. Even when
deciduous and mixed forests do burn, they do so at consistently lower
severity compared to all but the most xeric conifer forests
\citep{whitman2018}. Currently, biomass consumption estimates are based
on observed fire weather (and modelled using the Canadian Fire Behaviour
Prediction Systems) at the time of satellite fire activity detection,
but applied only at this spatially-referenced aggregated scale. Thus,
important biases in fire activity towards older and moderate to
poorly-drained forests are not resolved, and only a regionally-averaged
fire severity is applied.

To support recent advances in operational burn severity mapping for
Canada \citep{whitman2020} alongside multi-decade reliable burned area
records that provide certainty on fire start and end dates
\citep{hall2020} , the CBM DMs also need to be upgraded.

something about dynamic veg models like landis and how they represent
fire disturbance -then how most MRV models and quickly how they do fire
disturbance -even a bit on the GFED/GFAS world too

that ESSD frames it well, worth reading the intro part in detail)
(recent Smyth and Campbell papers too) (other recent Canadian
fire-carbon things, Walker - esp is supports consistent patterns in
proportional carbon loss)

In this document, we outline the evidence-based fire Disturbance
Matrices updated and designed for a spatially-explicit update to the
CBM, anchored in a three severity class paradigm. These fire carbon flux
models are built from a blend of aggregated field data linked to
remotely sensed severity, as well as insights from fire physics and
experimental fires. Key knowledge gaps are also highlighted, with
interim solutions presented until further quantification can be done in
field studies, such as from further wildfire observations, experimental
fires, or prescribed fires.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Biomass pools of the Generic Carbon Budget Model}

Short section explaining the pool definitions most relevant to fire.

\subsection{Axioms of forest carbon budget after fire}

To simplify the process of the creation of the DMs as a distillation of
the complexities of fire severity and combustion patterns, the following
logical axioms are proposed and maintained throughout:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Disturbance matrices are to be in terms of mortality, not survival
\item
  Crown Fraction Burned (CFB) is a mass-based estimate of the portion of
  foliage consumed in flaming, and is inclusive of merchantable and
  submerchantable trees, both broadleaf and needleleaf
\item
  Snags are inclusive of both those killed by prior fire as well as
  those killed by all other causes
\item
  In submerchantable trees, mortality = CFB
\item
  In submerchantable trees, mortality is \textless= 1
\item
  In merchantable stands, CFB \textless{} mortality
\item
  Survival = 1 - mortality
\item
  CFB \textless{} survival
\item
  The girdled fraction of trees = mortality - CFB
\item
  Survival \textless= 1 and also \textgreater= 0
\end{enumerate}

Of these, Crown Fraction Burned (CFB) is both highly critical and a
concept used primarily in fire behaviour science but not carbon
accounting nor fire ecology. CFB was introduced in the 1992 Fire
Behaviour Prediction System documentation, and provides a simple
continuous 0-100 variable for only the consumption of foliage (inclusive
of both conifer and broadleaf), as opposed to ordinal and less precise
systems like Crown Fire Severity Index that allows the user to specify
moreso which pools of canopy biomass are consumed, but not the degree to
which a given pool is consumed.

\subsection{Ground plot and remotely sensed fire severity data}

!!!Ellen to insert methods here - including the figure of where the
samples are from etc.

\subsection{Combustion gas emission ratios}

Certain variables, like the fractionation of CO2:CH4:CO, are constant
throughout ecozones, but vary by flaming vs smouldering. They are
defined in a global variables table:

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:globalVarsEmissions}Emissions factors in flaming and smouldering phase, expressed as portion of unburned biomass carbon content}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{l|r|r}
\hline
Spp & Flaming & Smouldering\\
\hline
CO2 & 0.868 & 0.703\\
\hline
CO & 0.070 & 0.161\\
\hline
PM10 & 0.022 & 0.048\\
\hline
NMOG & 0.016 & 0.035\\
\hline
PM25 & 0.019 & 0.040\\
\hline
CH4 & 0.005 & 0.013\\
\hline
BC & 0.001 & 0.000\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

where CO\textsubscript{2} is responsible for 86.8\% of emissions in the
flaming phase, but only 70.3\% of emissions in the smouldering phase,
with a doubling of CO emissions and tripling of CH\textsubscript{4}
emissions. With a Global Warming Potential of CO equal to 1.9 and
CH\textsubscript{4} of 25, the Global Warming Potential per unit of
biomass consumption in the smouldering phase is 1.18 times higher in
global warming potential compared to flaming, not including differential
aerosol production and injection heights, however. Note that these
proposed emissions factors for flaming vs smouldering are aligned with
those currently used in Canada's operational wildfire smoke air quality
model, FireWork \citep{chen2019}. With flaming and smouldering each
contributing roughly equally to wildfire emissions, these distinct
flaming and smouldering emissions rates correspond well with aircraft
smoke chemistry observations by \citep{simpson2011} and
\citep{hayden2022} and are themselves very similar to prior emissions
factors used in CBM. Note that as current described, the sum of
CO\textsubscript{2}, CH\textsubscript{4}, and CO emissions from
wildfires only represent approximately 95\% of the fire carbon mass
emitted to the atmosphere, with 0.5-2.0\% of biomass emitted as
particulate matter (e.g.~PM2.5, but also PM1 and PM10 classes of
particulates at 1 and 10 um diameters, respectively), and an additional
3\% \citep{hayden2022} to as little as 1\% \citep{simon2010} composed of
non-methane organic gases that have a large range in global warming
potentials as compared to CH\textsubscript{4}.

\subsection{Litter layer area-wise consumption by severity class}

The litter layer forms the first biomass pool in which a spreading fire
consumes fuel. In low-severity fires, the litter layer may be consumed
little to no underlying duff material consumed, nor any tree mortality
\citep{hessburg2019}. Logically, since litter consumption is required
for the ignition of the underlying duff layer, this litter area-wise
fractional consumption also informs and constrains duff consumption.

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:UnBurnedForestFloorByEcozone}Unburned litter area by ecozone and severity class.  The majority of the data comes from studies in the Boreal Plains and Boreal Shield West, and so values are extrapolated from those two well-observed ecozones to all others.}

\hline
P & 0.14 & 0.06 & 0.02\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Duff Consumption}

While consumption of fine fuels in the litter layer of the forest floor
is nearly complete for any given fire intensity, consumption of deeper
organic soil horizons (F+H layers in upland forests and upper peat
layers in wetlands) is more drought dependent. In this scheme, we
utilize the Forest Floor Fuel Consumption (FFFC) model and data of
\citep{degroot2009}, modified to compute the relative amount of
consumption (scalar from 0 to 1) rather than an absolute value in
\unit{0.2\,kg\,m^{-2}}:

\begin{equation}
logit(\frac{FFFC}{FFFL}) = DC^{0.33}(FFFL)^{-0.17}-4.85
\end{equation}

where DC is the Fire Weather Index Drought Code, and FFFL is the Forest
Floor Fuel Load (with ecozone averages given in \citep{letang2012} or
site-level data where observed). While ultimately this scheme can be
used on individual fires with estimated or measured fuel loading and
specific Drought Code values, for the purposes of this first assessment,
an ecozone-averaged fuel load and decadal composites of Drought Code is
used to provide representative values. Specifically, a median Drought
Code of detected fire hotspots in Canada from 2003-2021 using the same
data as the Canadian CFEEPS-FireWork wildfire air quality model of
\citep{chen2019} is presented below, along with proportional consumption
values of the forest floor by ecozone:

Little data is available on the fraction of woody debris consumption
alongside fire severity measurements. Coarse woody debris of overstory
stems that makes up 60-80\% of woody debris biomass in Canada's boreal
and temperate forests \citep{hanes2021}, with its moisture and
consumption patterns largely follows the moisture regime of the Drought
Code \citep{mcalpine1995}. In this modelling framework, the proportion
of coarse (\textgreater7.5 cm diameter) and medium (\textgreater0.5 cm
and \textless7.5 cm) woody debris consumption is estimated based on
detailed measurements of consumption from experimental fires. Coarse
Woody Debris is responsible for approximately 50-75\% of the total woody
debris load in most ecozones, and approximately 60\% of the total woody
debris consumption. Ecozone-level CWD consumption rates are summarized
as:

\begin{table}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Note that where historical burn severity data is not available, and
instead the fire classification type of surface, intermittent crowning,
and active crown fire are used as proxies for low, moderate, and high
severity fire, respectively. Fine woody debris \textless0.5 cm in
diameter is consumed at the exact same rate as the litter pool (see
section above).

\subsection{Drivers of C losses in the tree canopy}

\subsubsection{Overstory tree mortality and consumption}

Numerous process-driven \citep{michaletz2006} or empirical
\citep{hood2017} tree mortality models are present and show significant
skill in predicting tree mortality based on fire behaviour (i.e.~flame
length, rate of spread). Since the driving data in this model is
satellite-derived fire severity over the landscape scale, fire behaviour
metrics such as flame length or scorching height of bark are not
available as a continuous mapped product. Instead, softwood and hardwood
overstory mortality is calculated per ecozone as a function of
satellite-observed fire severity using aggregated ground plot data:

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:MortByEcozone}Softwood fractional mortality by ecozone, as dervied from median values from field studies}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{l|r|r|r}
\hline

TC & 0.24 & 0.65 & 0.98\\
\hline
PM & 0.13 & 0.38 & 0.97\\
\hline
AM & 0.28 & 0.34 & 0.95\\
\hline
MP & 0.28 & 0.34 & 0.95\\
\hline
P & 0.45 & 0.81 & 1.00\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

And since large-diameter, live trees killed by fire do not experience
significant live stemwood consumption, the entirity of the live stemwood
biomass pool that is killed is transferred to the snag pool. Note that
the field data and disturbance modelling undertaken here only accounts
for tree mortality within the calender year of the fire, and delayed
mortality of over one year has been documented in boreal low and
moderate severity fires \citep{angers2011}where less than half of total
mortality occurs after the year of the fire. The modelling here does not
account for delayed mortality, but rather than routine is a function of
the larger mortality schemes in GCBM.

Crown Fraction Burned (CFB) speaks to the fraction of the live canopy
that is itself consumed in the flaming front. The alternate outcomes
being survival of the foliage, or the mortality of the tree without
canopy consumption, resulting in the dropping of foliage onto the forest
floor. From the axioms stated earlier, the CFB must be lower than or
equal to the mortality rate, using field studies that show any partial
crown consumption is likely sufficient to result in high rates if not
complete mortality \citep{hood2017}, which is the case in Canada's trees
with primarily thin bark. From field studies (!Ellen to provide details
here\ldots.) , the following ecozone-specific CFB values are found:

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The consumption of live bark biomass is a pool in the model, and
consumption rates can be defined by severity class. At the moment,
lacking robust field data on bark biomass consumption rates across
ecozones and severity classes (which are a small portion of the overall
biomass), the bark proportional consumption rate is set to 34\% of the
overstory mortality rate, based only on a single well-observed high
severity fire in Taiga Plains by Santin 2015.

A major distinction is made between softwood and hardwood trees, where
in Canada's boreal forests, a large fraction of hardwood trees
(specifically of the genii Populous and Betula) are able to resprout
even when the main stem has been killed by an intense forest fire
\citep{brown1987}. Accordingly, the root mortality rates differ greatly
between softwoods and hardwoods, with softwood root mortality largely
equal to stem mortality, while in resprouting hardwoods, little root
mortality is observed even after intense fire
\citep{pérez-izquierdo2019}. Concurrently, the fraction of fine roots
contained within the combustible forest floor layers can be a close to
or exceeding 50\% of the fine root biomass \citep{strong1985}, and burns
alongside the organic soils \citep{benscoter2011}. As a result, the
calulation for softwood fine root consumption and mortality are as
follows, using Softwood as an example:

\begin{equation}
SWFineRootConsump = SW.Mort \times SW.Prop.Fine.Root.duff \times Duff.Consump.Fract
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
SWFineRootMort.AG = SW.Mort \times SW.Prop.Fine.Root.duff \times (1-Duff.Consump.Fract) \times (1-ReSproutFactor)
SWFineRootMort.BG = SW.Mort \times (1-SW.Prop.Fine.Root.duff)
\end{equation}

In contrast, the larger diameter of the coarse root biomass pool
prevents its consumption during any smouldering of the duff layer, and
the mortality rate of coarse roots is simply proportional to that of the
stemwood overall.

\subsubsection{Understory tree mortality and consumption}

Understory (or small diameter overstory) tree mortality is defined
seperately in the model, but given the lack of data on diameter classes
in the severity data, robust field data on differing mortality rates of
smaller diameter trees is not available, and so the understory tree
mortality rate is set equal to the overstory rate as defined in the
table above. Note that trees with a top height less than 1.4 m are not
considered in this pool, and instead are lumped into the ``other'' pool.

\subsubsection{Snag and stump consumption}

Compared to live stemwood of the same diameter, the low moisture content
of standing dead stemwood (snags) allows for much greater consumption
during the passage of an intense flaming front. The snag branch pool
experiences almost complete combustion, while the largest biomass pool
of the main standing dead stemwood

\subsection{Field case studies (for consideration)}

\begin{verbatim}
### table with rows are CBM pools, columns (paird) are obs
### and modelled exp fires

### fires that would work:

### ICFME (SW TP High); Sharpsands 2007 (SW BSE High),
### Lafoe (HW BSE Low), CWS C-7 burns (SW MC Mod), Carrot
### lake (SW MC High)

### variables specifically measured during an experimental
### fire, in the verbiage of the fire DMs:
exp.fire.table.defs <- c("SW.CFB", "HW.CFB", "SW.Mort", "HW.Mort",
    "SW.SubMerch.Mort", "HW.SubMerch.Mort", "SmTree.Mort", "SW.Snag.Comb.Frac",
    "HW.Snag.Comb.Frac", "MedDOM.Comb.Frac", "Duff.consump.frac")

## then, take the list above, and look up the same row but
## the column 'Plain.Language.Name' in FireDMTableDefs.csv:
## exp.fire.table.labels <-

## note that Duff.consump.frac is an ecozone variable, not
## in FireDMTableDefs.csv

## list of all possible CBM pools measured during an
## experimental fire:
exp.fire.pools <- c("Softwood Foliage", "Softwood Other", "Aboveground Very Fast DOM",
    "Aboveground Fast DOM", "Medium DOM", "Aboveground Slow DOM",
    "Softwood Stem Snag", "Hardwood Other", "Hardwood Stem Snag")

### fun idea: ternary plots of live vs combusted vs dead
### for each of these fires, modelled vs observed?
### https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Ternary/vignettes/Ternary.html
### with the colour being the fuel type/leading spp and
### size being total emissions?  can we draw lines in
### between pairs of mod vs obs in that package? TernaryApp
### function in the package should apparently let you draw
### connected points?
\end{verbatim}

ICFME has detailed, for high severity.

Another option would be Lafoe Creek mixedwood burns, which would need
some sort of CFB and mortality estimate. Is the pre-fire fuel load
documented somewhere?

Pelican would work too, less on the bark consumption etc though.

And last, maybe something from Carrot lake or similarly well-observed BC
fire?

Compare each pool's observed vs modelled relative consumption rates
using (ideally) dNBR to drive severity class from the real data.

Use exactly the FBP DataFrame, no need for anything duplicating that
otherwise. Am going to compute proportional combustion from the FBP Data
frame anyways.

\subsection{1990-2020(1) GCBM BC annual C stocks estimates with new fire
DM scheme}

Give quick summary here, show overview map of all the fires, and also an
example of the GCBM biomass pools and also severity classes on a fire or
two from Ellen

\begin{verbatim}
## maybe just a figure of the fires labelled by year and
## perhaps a pie(?) chart of their severity portions as
## mapped?
\end{verbatim}

Then compare old vs new fire DM scheme for some (all?) individual fires
as a biplot

\begin{verbatim}
### let's assume all the GCBM processing has been done.

### biplot of CO2e total per fire, comparing old scheme vs
### new.  Gets you an idea of how it scales vs size of
### fire.  Colour for ecozone within BC?
\end{verbatim}

Then the annual GCBM runs with old and new scheme.

\begin{verbatim}
### let's assume all the GCBM processing has been done.

### times series or biplot?  Time series seems the one they
### default too. Maybe both?

### Just the two lines (old vs new) as CO2e per year, or do
### we get to also show anything else?  Maybe annual PM2.5
### gets in an appendix, since there's no old vs new.

### fun followup graph: with the new system only (?) total
### area burned vs total CO2e, showing that there's not as
### much of a constant slope as you think?  That the
### CO2e/ha can really vary between years.
\end{verbatim}

\section{Discussion}

-some discussion points (unordered) so far

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  given the generic nature of these DMs and their simple relative
  simplicity, can be added to other frameworks like LANDIS (see Stenzel
  2019 as well, they do some of that).
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  paragraph on extended impacts like delayed stem mortality, rapid snag
  fall, and changes (or not) in duff decomposition rates. Not (as of
  yet) covered in this 1-timestep pulse disturbance described here.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}

The conclusion goes here.

\section{Appendix C: DM template (can delete in final draft)}

First, a generic template for a fire DM is loaded, that can represent
any ecozone. It comes in two parts: (1) a list of variables, some
biophysical and not relating to fire severity (such as the portion of
live branchwood that falls into the smaller size fraction); or (2)
severity-specific variables (such as Crown Fraction Burn) for a severity
class. The template is loaded, and replicated across the list of
ecozones (or any spatial unit) desired. Other processes, such as the
analysis of field data, can then be used to fill in ecozone-specific
variables in severity classes.

An example of the variable definition template is as follows:

\begin{table}[!h]

\caption{\label{tab:varDefsExample}Example of stored fire disturbance matrix precursor variable information}
\centering
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{
\begin{tabular}[t]{l|l|l|l|r|l|l|l}
\hline
Ecozone & Pool & Plain.Language.Name & Variable.Name & Value & SeverityClass & InterimValue & Notes\\
\hline
AM & AGFastDOM & Woody Debris Portion of AGFastDOM & CWD.frac.of.AGFastDOM & 0.5 &  & TRUE & \\
\hline
BC & AGFastDOM & Woody Debris Portion of AGFastDOM & CWD.frac.of.AGFastDOM & 0.5 &  & TRUE & \\
\hline
BP & AGFastDOM & Woody Debris Portion of AGFastDOM & CWD.frac.of.AGFastDOM & 0.5 &  & TRUE & \\
\hline
BSW & AGFastDOM & Woody Debris Portion of AGFastDOM & CWD.frac.of.AGFastDOM & 0.5 &  & TRUE & \\
\hline
BSE & AGFastDOM & Woody Debris Portion of AGFastDOM & CWD.frac.of.AGFastDOM & 0.5 &  & TRUE & \\
\hline
HP & AGFastDOM & Woody Debris Portion of AGFastDOM & CWD.frac.of.AGFastDOM & 0.5 &  & TRUE & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}}
\end{table}

A plain language name for each variable is provided right in the data,
as well.

A second template defines each flux in a Disturbance Matrix, with Source
and Sink defined as precise character variables, and a plain language
summary (``Process Synonym'') included to tie this flux back to language
used in the fire science literature. Pseudocode and notes are included
in each flux, which is repeated for each fire severity class and
ecozone. There are 3900 total fluxes, though many do not have sufficient
information to describe differences between ecozones. Many of these are
computed automatically, tying back into variables such as Crown Fraction
Burned.

\begin{table}[!h]

\caption{\label{tab:SinkSourceExample}Sample of disturbance matrix data file}
\centering
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{
\begin{tabular}[t]{l|r|l|l|l|l|l|l|r|l}
\hline
Ecozone & FluxID & Source & Sink & ProcessSynonym & Pseudocode & Notes & SeverityClass & Value & InterimValue\\
\hline
BSW & 1 & Softwood Merchantable & Softwood Merchantable & Survival rate of large conifers & 1-mortality rate & Ellen provides & Low & 1.0 & TRUE\\
\hline
TP & 1 & Softwood Merchantable & Softwood Merchantable & Survival rate of large conifers & 1-mortality rate & Ellen provides & Low & 1.0 & TRUE\\
\hline
TSW & 1 & Softwood Merchantable & Softwood Merchantable & Survival rate of large conifers & 1-mortality rate & Ellen provides & Low & 0.9 & TRUE\\
\hline
BP & 1 & Softwood Merchantable & Softwood Merchantable & Survival rate of large conifers & 1-mortality rate & Ellen provides & Low & 1.0 & TRUE\\
\hline
BC & 1 & Softwood Merchantable & Softwood Merchantable & Survival rate of large conifers & 1-mortality rate & Ellen provides & Low & 1.0 & TRUE\\
\hline
BSE & 1 & Softwood Merchantable & Softwood Merchantable & Survival rate of large conifers & 1-mortality rate & Ellen provides & Low & 1.0 & TRUE\\
\hline
\end{tabular}}
\end{table}

With both generic ecozone variables as well as severity-specific
variables defined and the pseudocode for each flux included, actual DM
values are computed as references to tables, subset by ecozone and
severity class.

Note that rather than defining softwood crown fraction burned as a
variable called ``SW.CFB.Boreal.Plains'' for each ecozone, there is a
row in the VarDefs table that represents SW.CFB in each ecozone and for
each severity class, thus avoiding the creation of large lists of
manually entered variable names and values in the R environment.
Instead, these values can be programmatically entered via external
analysis of plot data (not covered here).

\section{Appendix D: Representative photos}

Photos of: (1) partial litter consumption; (2) partial vs full duff
consumption; (3) mortality but not consumption of understory trees with
live overstory; (4) mortality but not consumption of overstory trees;
(5) mixedwood severity example showing consumption of broadleaf foliage;
(6) woody debris consumption; (7) snag preferential consumption relative
to little to no bole consumpotion in live trees

Give lat/long, year, ecozone, severity class, and leading spp for each
photo, maybe other relevant metrics? From some of the experimental fires
mostly??

\appendix
\section{List of fluxes and corresponding fire-related plain-language summary}

Regarding figures and tables in appendices, the following two options
are possible depending on your general handling of figures and tables in
the manuscript environment:

\subsection{Option 1}

If you sorted all figures and tables into the sections of the text,
please also sort the appendix figures and appendix tables into the
respective appendix sections. They will be correctly named
automatically.

\subsection{Option 2}

If you put all figures after the reference list, please insert appendix
tables and figures after the normal tables and figures.

To rename them correctly to A1, A2, etc., please add the following
commands in front of them: \texttt{\textbackslash{}appendixfigures}
needs to be added in front of appendix figures
\texttt{\textbackslash{}appendixtables} needs to be added in front of
appendix tables

Please add \texttt{\textbackslash{}clearpage} between each table and/or
figure. Further guidelines on figures and tables can be found below.
