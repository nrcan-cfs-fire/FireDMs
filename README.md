# FireDMs
Programmatically-defined disturbance matrices for the geospatial Carbon Budget Model

With severity mapping, a new approach to fire disturbanace matrices in the GCBM is required.

This repo creates DMs for CBM using a logical and programmatic technique that borrow from (1) field observations; (2) combustion physics and observations; (3) knowledge of fire ecology-related plant traits; and (4) broad distributions of forest species across Canadian ecozones.
